      <b><u>Example 1</u></b>

    <img

    <p>
      The image captures a sweet moment between a young girl and a small gray
      rabbit. The girl, who has long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, is
      lying on her stomach, resting her chin on her hand. She is gently holding
      the rabbit beside her, smiling softly at the camera. The background is
      light and airy, creating a calm and happy atmosphere. Presumably, the
      bunny is the girl's pet.

      alt="image"

    <p>
      The image captures a moment from a women's basketball game. Two players
      are in focus, one wearing a white uniform and the other in a black
      uniform" The player in white is on defense, closely guarding the player in
      black who has the ball. The player in black appears to be looking for a
      teammate to pass the ball to. The gymnasium's floor is shiny and
      reflective, and other players can be seen in the background.
